Visual Fret are Jupyternotebooks for visualization and analysis of experimental fluorescence measurements. 

The Jupyternotebook "linearity_errors bars_SI" can be used to study the linearity of a fluorescent dye.

The Jupyternotebook "data_analysis_SI" can be used for the correction of measured emission values. Here the values were determined with a fluorometer/fluorescence spectrometer. After correction, FRET signal and quenching probability can be calculated and also displayed termperature dependent.
