<img align="left" width="400px" src="docs/images/VisualFretLogo.png">

Visual Fret are Jupyternotebooks for visualization and analysis of experimental fluorescence measurements.

The Jupyternotebook "linearity_errors bars_SI" can be used to study the linearity of a fluorescent dye.

The Jupyternotebook "data_analysis_SI" can be used for the correction of measured emission values. Here the values were determined with a fluorometer/fluorescence spectrometer. After correction, FRET signal and quenching probability can be calculated and also displayed termperature dependent. 

## Installation

Clone or download Visual_FRET into your working directory.
```
https://github.com/BoernerLab/Visual_FRET.git
```
Within Jupyter-Lab or Jupyter-Notebook you can open the .ipynb files and then comple the code.

The following packages are required:
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
